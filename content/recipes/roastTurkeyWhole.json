        "You should definitely make Turkey Gravy to go with this roast!",
        "Take the Turkey out of the fridge and let rest for ~20 minutes",
        "Unpack the Turkey and set aside the neck/giblets for Turkey Stock",
        "Place Turkey on a Roasting Rack over a Roasting Pan",
        "Cut off any chunks of excess skin/bone/fat for Stock as well",
        "Mix Salt, Sugar and Black Pepper together",
        "Put on some food prep gloves (required, trust me)",
        "Starting at the neck hole, wedge your hand between the meat and skin",
        "Be sure to maintain the integrity of the skin as you push in",
        "Keep working your hand deeper, separating skin from the breasts",
        "Once the skin's detached from the breasts, work to the legs",
        "The skin should be detached from the breasts and legs, and intact",
        "Take 2/3 of the dry mix, spread evenly over the meat under the skin",
        "Add Baking Powder to the remaining 1/3 of the dry mixture",
        "Mix thoroughly and sprinkle/rub atop the skin of the bird",
        "Tie the legs together with butcher's twine to keep cavity open",
        "Tuck the wing tips under the Turkey (takes a little force)",
        "Leave the Turkey in the fridge uncovered for 24 hours to dry",
        "Take the Turkey out of the fridge",
        "Remove the Turkey/Roasting Rack from the Roasting Pan",
        "Put a pizza stone in the oven on the lowest rack",
        "Ensure there's enough clearance in the oven for your bird to fit",
        "Preheat to 400F convection (425F normal)",
        "Drain/dry the Roasting Pan and place directly on the pizza stone",
        "Let the oven, pan, and stone heat for an hour",
        "Put on some food prep gloves (required, hurts otherwise)",
        "Evenly spread 4/5 of the Turkey Butter Rub under the Turkey's skin",
        "Evenly spread 1/5 of the Turkey Butter Rub atop the Turkey's skin",
        "Cut the Lemon, and Halve the Onions and the Garlic Head",
        "Stuff the Lemon, Onions, and Garlic Head into the bird's cavity",
        "Take some Tin Foil and fold to cover the breasts",
        "Press Tin Foil onto the breasts so it protects the white meat",
        "Once the Roasting Pan has heated for an hour, take it out",
        "Pour Olive Oil into the pan",
        "Take the bird off the Roasting Rack and place directly on pan",
        "Put the Pan/Bird back on the Pizza Stone and let fry for 45 minutes",
        "Take the Pan/Bird out, and put the Bird back on the Roasting Rack",
        "Change the oven temperature to 300F convection (or 325F normal)",
        "Put the Rack/Bird back in the Pan, and roast another 3 hours",
        "Every bird is different, use discretion and monitor every 15 minutes",
        "Pull the Bird from the oven",
        "Check the deepest part of the breast with a meat thermometer",
        "If less than 160F, take out the termometer and put the bird back in",
        "Once the breast hits 160F, take it out for carry-over to finish it",
        "Let rest for an hour and a half at room temperature",
        "After a half hour of resting, save drippings for Jake's Turkey Gravy",
        "Warm a heatable serving plate for presenting carved turkey bits",
        "After the 1.5 hour rest, carve the turkey, keeping skin on pieces"
